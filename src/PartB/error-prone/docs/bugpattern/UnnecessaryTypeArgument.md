Surprisingly, JLS ยง15.12.2.1 allows non-generic methods to be invoked with type
arguments:

> a non-generic method may be potentially applicable to an invocation that
> supplies explicit type arguments. Indeed, it may turn out to be applicable.
> In such a case, the type arguments will simply be ignored.

However, in cases where the method being called is not an override of a generic
method, there is no reason to allow this, and it is potentially confusing.
This check flags only cases where the substitutability principle does not
apply.
